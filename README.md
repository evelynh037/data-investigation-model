## Problem Identification


## Baseline Model
We choose to use a tree decision model for our baseline model. There are 4 predictor variables included in this model. For quantitative variables, we directly derive 3 varibles from the dataset: 'minutes','n_steps', and'n_ingredients'. When thinking about categorical variables, we think that whether the users write review carefully can also be a factor related to the rating. Therefore, we choose to perform FunctionTransform on 'review', and choose 'review' as our categorical variable.
